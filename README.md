# ETDSPC
ETDSPC-01

# Description of Qualifications
ETDSPC aims to give the students insight into system design in FPGAs. By combining custom hardware written in VHDL with a microprocessor, we can achieve high flexibility, high performance and a small footprint. The students will be trained in designing and implementing feasible designs. In addition, the students will learn methods for testing these designs.

When the course is completed, the students are expected to be able to:

- Implement programs for FPGAs, written in VHDL
- Use ModelSim and test benches to simulate VHDL designs
- Explain the concepts: clock domains, clock skew, pipelining, PLL and memory components
- Use soft cores to build an SoC (System On Chip) system
- Implement C programs to run on SoC
- Implement signal processing algorithms in VHDL
